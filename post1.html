    <h2>Post 1</h2>
    <p>Recently, I feel that time is passing too fast every day, so fast that I don't have time to catch my breath. In the classroom, library, dormitory, and even on the way to the cafeteria, my brain is calculating the next plan: How many chapters are left to review? Can I submit next week's project on time? Should I add another programming language to the skills column of my resume? While the teacher assigns new tasks, the positions on the recruitment website are written one by one as "at least two years of experience" - but I haven't even officially done an internship. Sometimes at two o'clock in the morning, I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling, my mind is full of "What if my GPA is lower this semester?", "What if I can't find a job in the fall recruitment?", "What if... I'm not good enough?" The heavy pressure is like a boulder, pressing on my chest, and I can't escape. The classmates around me are also very busy, but they seem to be calmer than me. I dare not tell my parents too much, for fear that they will worry. I just smile and say in the occasional video: "It's okay, it's quite fulfilling." I know that this kind of anxiety is not only me. But when the night is quiet, it floods me like a tide, reminding me: the future is already standing at the door and knocking, and I am not ready yet.</p>
    <p>This semester is particularly stressful. Every day when I wake up, I start to calculate the tasks in my mind: the paper is not finished yet, the project ddl is coming soon, and I have to prepare for the autumn recruitment. The more I think about it, the more anxious I am, and the more anxious I am, the more I can't concentrate on studying. Sometimes I am still browsing positions at two or three o'clock in the morning, and I feel disappointed when I see "two years of experience required". I don't even have a decent internship, how can I compete with so many excellent people? On the one hand, I am worried about failing the course, and on the other hand, I am afraid that I can't find a job after graduation. Everyone around me is working hard, but I always feel that I am going in circles. I dare not say too much to my family, I can only smile and say "it's fine", but in fact I am almost overwhelmed every day. I know I can't stop, but I am really tired. Sometimes I really hope that time can stop for a while and let me take a breath.</p>
