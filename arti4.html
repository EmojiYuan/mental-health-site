    <h2>Bullying</h2>
    <p>Bullying can be a major cause of mental illnesses in students and its effects are long-lasting. When students are bullied at school or online, they often feel scared, lonely, and helpless. They may start to believe the hurtful things others say about them, which lowers their self-esteem and confidence. Over time, these negative emotions can build up and lead to serious mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and even thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Most students will decide not to go to school, lose interest in the things they once enjoyed, or begin isolating themselves from friends and family. There's a great chance that their grades will drop and they will struggle to focus because they feel so overwhelmed. Bullying doesn’t just leave physical scars—it leaves emotional wounds that can affect a person for years. That’s why it’s so important for schools, families, and communities to take bullying seriously, offer support to those affected, and create a safe environment where everyone feels valued and accepted.</p>
