    <h2>Post 1</h2>
    <p>I have a friend who has been in a very bad mood recently. Whether chatting, doing things, or just a little friction, he is prone to outbursts, and sometimes even jokes can make him angry. At first I thought I said something wrong, but later I found that he was like this to everyone. I began to feel very depressed, and I had to be very careful every time I got along with him, for fear of touching his emotional minefield. We used to have a good relationship, but now I am increasingly afraid to get close to him. Although I know that he may be under a lot of pressure or have something on his mind, I also have my own emotions that need to be taken care of. I am very conflicted. On the one hand, I want to help him, but on the other hand, I donâ€™t want to be affected by negative emotions all the time. I hope he can realize his state and be willing to open up.</p>
