    <h2>Mental Illnesses Can be Contagious</h2>
    <p>Mental illnesses can sometimes seem contagious, not in the way a plague spreads, but through close relationships and shared environments. When someone in a family or a friend group is under severe depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, others around them may start to feel the same negative effects. They might begin to feel sad, stressed, or overwhelmed just by being around that person every day. This can happen because people often take on the emotions of those they care about, especially when they don’t know how to help. That’s why it’s important for everyone to learn about mental health, support each other, and take care of their own well-being.</p>
