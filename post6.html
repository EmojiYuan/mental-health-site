    <h2>Post 6</h2>
    <p>Every day when I turn on the TV, Japanese and Korean variety shows and idol dramas are overwhelming. The stars on the screen are all as thin as paper, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and perfect smiles on their faces. They seem to have no extra fat and never look tired. Even if they are just a supporting role, they look more "perfect" than me who has been working hard for several months. I know that it is part of their work and the image packaged by the team, but I still can't help comparing myself.</p>
    <p>Every time I look in the mirror, I can't help but look at my stomach, legs and face, picking out a bunch of "shortcomings". I started counting calories when I ate, and I felt guilty when I saw desserts. Friends joked that I "wanted to be thin and greedy", I smiled on the surface, but I felt even more sad inside. It seems that if I am not thin enough, I am not worthy of appearing in front of people; if I am not "standard", I will be looked down upon.</p>
    <p>This anxiety is like a shadow, following me into the gym and following me to browse social platforms late at night. I know that beauty should not have only one standard, and I know that everyone's body rhythm is different, but the inferiority complex of "I am not good enough" always reappears, making me breathless. How I wish that one day I could truly accept myself, instead of living in the aesthetics of others. Have you ever felt inferior in this way?</p>
