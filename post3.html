    <h2>Post 1</h2>
    <p>I have realized that I am different from others since adolescence. This identity often makes me feel lonely and afraid. I am afraid of being discovered by my family, afraid of losing friends, and even more afraid of being discriminated against by society. Every time I hear people around me jokingly belittling homosexuals, I can only pretend that it doesn't matter, but my heart is extremely painful. I try to make myself look "normal" and suppress my true emotions just to avoid being rejected. For a long time, this hiding and self-denial has brought deep anxiety and depression. I long to be understood and accepted, but the reality makes me constantly doubt whether my existence is allowed.</p>
