    <h2>Post 2</h2>
    <p>I am the top scorer in the college entrance examination in Shanghai. This is glory, success, and the pinnacle of the so-called "other people's children" in the eyes of many people. But they don't know that behind my success, there is a dark period that almost swallowed me and my family.</p>
    <p>In my first year of high school, I suffered from depression. At first, I just had no interest in life, and slowly became insomnia, aversion to school, self-denial, and finally even had the idea of ​​committing suicide. I didn't dare to tell anyone, for fear of being regarded as "fragile" and "pretentious", and afraid of disappointing my parents' expectations. But emotions are like tides, pushing me down again and again. My mother was originally the strongest person in our family, but when she found out that I was ill, her spirit slowly collapsed. She stayed with me day and night, dared not sleep, and even began to have delusions. Our family fell into an abyss that could not breathe together.</p>
    <p>I thought I had ruined everything and was a complete loser. But later I received treatment and met teachers and friends who were willing to really listen to me. I began to understand that depression is not weakness, but a disease, just like a cold, which needs to be seen, understood, and cured.</p>
    <p>Now, my grades are still excellent, and on the surface, I am "shining" again. But what I want to tell others is that true strength is not never falling, but being able to stand up again and again in despair. I also want to say to all those who are still in pain: You are not alone, your emotions are real, and you deserve to be understood and loved. Although the darkness is long, the light will surely come.</p>
