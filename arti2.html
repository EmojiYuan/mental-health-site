    <h2>High Academic Pressure at School</h2>
    <p>In East Asian countries, the importance of education is extremely exaggerated and students are encouraged to compete with each other under systems built upon high academic expectations. As Tan and Yates (2011) explain, "the expectations of parents, teachers and students themselves to excel academically can also be a source of intense stress for many students" (p. 389). And this stress from the system will gradually evolve into serious mental issues. In Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) societies, education is also closely tied to future success, which will also influence family honor. Thus, students will carry this extra burden of honoring their family. Another concept critical to understanding this phenomenon is "involution." Zhao and Zhu (2019) define involution as a process where individuals are trapped in endless competition without achieving substantial progress. They explain that "the phenomenon of involution is inevitable in the development process, and only deepening the reform according to the national conditions is an important way to break the involution" (Zhao & Zhu, 2019, p. 562). This issue of academic suffering is a systemic issue that has least relation with individual inabilities and weakness.
