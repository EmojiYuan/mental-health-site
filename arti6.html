    <h2>LGBTQ+ Identities</h2>
    <p>Education about gender and sexuality is rarely covered in Asian education. Homosexual marriages are even considered illegal in several countries. Children who alter their self-concept to conform to gender role expectations may experience difficulties in their later sexual life or harassment and abuse. Such education without counter-narratives provides students with LGBTQ+ identities additional pressure while actively negotiating their identities within constraints of social expectations. There is a theory called “panoptic gaze.” Panoptic gaze is a feeling of a silent and invisible overseer upon people, a feeling that creates a society where docile citizens self-discipline in order to avoid punishment. Whereas people under panoptic gaze feel the supervision mainly from the government while students with LGBTQ+ identities within these regions are under supervision that extends beyond the state to the entire social and cultural aspect. To avoid potential prejudice from their family and peers, many have to hide their true thoughts and feelings, adding risks to their mental status.</p>
